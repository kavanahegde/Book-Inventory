A **Book Inventory Table** built with **HTML** and **CSS**, displaying a list of books with their **Title, Author, Category, Status, and Rating**. Each book is visually styled according to its reading status, and ratings are represented with colored dots.

## 📝 Features
- **Dynamic Status Highlighting**:  
  - Read → Green gradient  
  - To Read → Orange gradient  
  - In Progress → Blue gradient
- **Rating Visualization**: Ratings are represented as three dots, filled based on the personal rating (one, two, three).
- **CSS Attribute Selectors**: Rows and spans are styled using precise attribute selectors. Example: `tr[class="read"]`, `span[class="status"]`, `span[class~="one"]`, `span[class~="two"]`, `span[class~="three"]`.
- **Responsive & Accessible**: Simple table layout, easy to read, and visually distinct statuses.
